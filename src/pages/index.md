<!-- Your About Me section -->

Hi, I'm an independent bot developer based in Philippines Manila.

My passion is coding whatever comes to mind. Some of my projects are built from scratch, and while they may appear similar to others, mine have improved code. Most of what I do is self-made; I enjoy creating bots, retrieving Facebook accounts, and sometimes conducting penetration testing.

I'm interested also  game , studying and experimenting with web design.
